# Exercism Exercises

Exercism is a great platform for learning to solve problems with code. It's geared towards beginner and intermediate learners which makes it perfect for me. I try to do 1-3 exercises a day from both Exercism and Leetcode, 2-4 hours of data structures & algos study, and 1-3 hours of portfolio project work.
